I was born at April the 15th at mexico city, studied a bachelors degree at National Autonomous University of Mexico about Petroleum Engineering, then I was recruited by Schlumberger at my university and started working as Production engineer/Production technologist as consultor mainly for PEMEX. The must important achievements at slb are at ogarrio oil field and panuco oil field. Ogarrio oil field is a mature oil field where we increased production from 1000 bpd to 16000 bpd through reservoir dynamic and static characterization. The ogarrio oil field produces light oil.
Panuco oil field is a heavy oil producer from a naturally fractured reservoir that was producing less than 1000 bpd before schlumberger started to operate the oil field, I worked there at a pilot project of steam injection as a enhanced oil recovery method that achieved 3000 bpd.<br><br>
Later I finished a master of engineering degree at National Autonomous University of Mexico as Reservoir Engineering where I was enrolled in numeric methods and numeric simulation courses that consists of mathematical modeling of petroleum industry phenomenon, I presented a COMSOL final project applying navier-stokes equations, at faculty of engineering courses are taught in fortran. I have a strong background of programming since 17 years old when I started programing HTML, php, SLQ, highschool courses about C, C++, VisualBasic. Then recently I have leaned python which to me is similar to php but easier. As petroleum engineering student and master of engineering student duiring my studies I had to code a lot of scientific scripts mainly in fortran, but I have acquired some UI development skills by myself, mainly webapps. My thesis to complete my master of engineering degree was a developed mathematical model of pressure tests at oil wells. <br><br>
Since october 2021, I'm working in a prototype about oil data management, it's coded in php, html, javascript, SQL, by now and will include python, and its libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras to make it capable of ML, AI, DL, NLP functions and is intended to be a portable script able to work in any web server at petroleum companies or from the cloud.
